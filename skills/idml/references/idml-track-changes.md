# Track changes and IDML

When exporting IDML from InDesign, disable Track Changes. Exporting with tracked changes can create inconsistent or unexpected IDML output.

Suggested workflow:
1. Turn on Track Changes in InDesign.
2. Accept or reject all changes.
3. Turn off Track Changes.
4. Export to IDML.
